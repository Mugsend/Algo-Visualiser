# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
The Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to visualize the step-by-step execution of popular sorting algorithms including Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Quick Sort. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and provides an interactive interface to understand the inner workings of these sorting algorithms.

## Features
Visualization of Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Quick Sort algorithms.
Interactive user interface with visualizations of array elements and algorithm steps.
Ability to adjust the speed of the visualization to match personal preference.
Play, pause, and reset options to control the visualization.
Real-time visualization of algorithm steps with highlighting of array elements being compared or swapped.

## Getting Started

Go to the project page (https://mugsend.github.io/Sorting_Algorithm_Visualiser/) or -
Follow the steps below to get the Algorithm Visualizer up and running on your local machine:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Choose an algorithm from the available options (Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, or Quick Sort).
4. Input an array of elements to be sorted or generate a random array.
5. Click the "Visualize" button to start the visualization.
6. Adjust the speed using the speed slider to control the visualization speed.
7. Use the play, pause, and reset buttons to control the visualization process.
8. Observe the visualization of the algorithm's steps and the changes in the array elements in real-time.
9. Read the detailed explanations of each algorithm's steps and time complexity for better understanding.
